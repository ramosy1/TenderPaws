## Overview

<p><b>Tech used: </b>HTML5, CSS3</p>

Pupsome Cookies and Grooming was created as a fictitious pet grooming business where dog moms and dads feel safe in knowing their pupsome family member gets the best service. And of course, no pup ever leaves the grounds without a cookie treat. This project was built as a responsive landing page highlighting the business' services, contact info, and social channels.
